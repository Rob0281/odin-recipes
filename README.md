Following the assignment I built out the files and folders necassary,
then started building  each page one at a time. Adding the information in the format desired, then adding the link on the index page.
Attempted to add a link back to the index page, wasn't sure how to do it properly so left well enough alone.

Most of the html is not new to me, however using Git and Git Hub are new, I like being able to use version control.
